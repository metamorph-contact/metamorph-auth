# Shared Identity Frontend

Metamorph Auth is the realm common identity browser application. It renders a
catalog-admitted product presentation while Metamorph SaaS owns credentials,
sessions, tenants, audit, and the sole common RBAC evaluator.

The frontend implements authorization entry, account choice, email/password
sign-in, signup and verification, organization/individual continuation,
profile name/handle/color/picture, recovery, destination finalization, and
single-account/browser-wide logout. Product backends implement none of this
protocol. CSI-13 defines the trusted product boundary, CSI-15 exposes the SaaS
routes through regional product API hosts and cuts over Octamorph, and CSI-16
closes the focused post-cutover security/engineering review.

Plan 02 Packet G adds the optional source-P product-route-move receipt to the
generated CSI-07 account-selection request and typed client. The normal caller
omits it; only a future explicit product-flow relocation may supply the proof.
Profile and admin session/device pages are product-owned and live in
Octamorph, so this identity frontend has no corresponding fixture to replace.

Security invariants are catalog-pinned origins and navigation, protected
fragment scrubbing before parsing, exact browser/tab recovery state, no
credential persistence or logging, strict bounded/versioned response decoding,
same-attempt response-loss recovery without retaining passwords, required
idempotency, bounded partial multi-home reads, and authoritative logout
completion before local cleanup. Every endpoint uses the single current
`ProtocolErrorV1` contract; pre-cutover retained error names and client methods
are not accepted.

Presentation follows system mode. Polymorph owns the fade choreography and
two-pixel transition progress; internal transitions move focus to their new
heading. Signup controls are prefetched, translations are module-owned, and
profile image editing plus color selection use Polymorph. Theme pairings are
admitted then generated into static first-party CSS. CSI-12 adds CSP-safe
standalone runtime validators, short-lived exact recovery receipts, a scoped
WCAG 2.2 AA identity contrast gate, responsive overflow checks, collision-safe
translation bundles, and localized document/toast chrome.
CSI-16 additionally scrubs and conceals the complete identity document before
BFCache suspension and retains only the bounded non-authorizing receipt needed
to recover destination completion after refresh.

Generated DTOs and schemas come from `../metamorph-saas`; never edit them here.
The [central first-party browser contract](../../../../metamorph-saas/docs/features/authentication/contracts/central-first-party-browser-v1.md)
is the durable protocol boundary; CSI packet records are historical
development rationale, not a competing wire contract.
See [status](status.md) for current evidence and deferred work.

Plan 01 provides development-only core identity previews at
`/{locale}/_preview/enterprise-security/{screenId}` for `SCR-IDN-001` and
`SCR-IDN-011`–`SCR-IDN-017`. The lazy feature module uses generated enterprise
method/admission DTOs and existing CSI response types with deterministic,
non-secret fixture states. Its own translation namespace loads with the
module. Existing CSI sign-in, signup, verification, recovery, and finalization
routes remain the production behavior. Preview selections have no live effect;
enterprise live adapters fail closed until their owning plans wire the guarded
APIs.

Packet J's passkey, authenticator-code, recovery-code, step-up, and recovery-
status previews use a second development-only lazy module. Its browser
credential adapter is inert in preview, and its fixtures cannot issue a
credential result or action proof.

Packet K's SAML/OIDC, emergency, JIT profile, and SCIM activation previews use
a third development-only lazy module. Its JIT sample carries the generated
profile-completion request shape, including handle, first name, avatar fallback,
and a null privacy handoff; it does not submit a profile or invent a receipt.
Packet L's recipient inbox uses a fourth
lazy module and the separately generated authorization recipient contract. It
shows pinned offers, redacted claim-required teasers, queued decisions, local
skip, and read-only completion without contacting a live invitation handler.
Its development preview route is `/{locale}/_preview/enterprise-security/SCR-IDN-009`;
production registration waits for the guarded authorization owner gate.

The checked-in UI release and generated browser trust are build inputs, not
runtime suggestions. Octamorph's build verifies its generated product trust
against the admitted deployment catalog and this exact UI release. A release or
catalog change that is not regenerated therefore fails the product build.


## Plan 09 live SCIM workspace — EA-09F

The controlled identity page at
`/$locale/auth/$authProjectionId/$catalogVersion/scim/activate` consumes the
closed protected SCIM entry before catalog fetch. It chooses only a verified
catalog region endpoint, sends no browser session, validates generated request/
response shapes and bounds, and retains exact uncertain retries only in memory.
Independent email verification and a distinct completion capability lead to
`pending_provisioning`; canonical identity and team access are not inferred.
Pagehide removes the flow and capabilities; restored pages require a fresh
entry. Completion or terminal failure clears entry custody. All visible copy is
in `src/i18n/locales/en/scim.json`. The local generator/check scripts consume the
three SaaS Rust operation schemas and the sole HTTP register.

These are live adapters with explicit unavailable owner states. Actual runtime,
primary-email/global proof, encrypted notification delivery and authorization
recipient behavior remain in the SaaS 09I ledger. Development UI/contract checks
are distinct from human interoperability or live authority acceptance.

EA-09F is development-complete: 34 focused frontend checks and TypeScript/
owning validator checks pass; final readonly bug/security/performance rereviews
are CLEAN. Human/runtime and adjacent-owner integration remain in SaaS EA-09I.
